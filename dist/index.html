      <h2>COMPANIES & PROJECTS</h2>
      <p> Over the last 10 years, I've been the Founder and worked for two startup companies</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.shakacuts.co.uk/">Shaka Cuts</a></p>  
      <p>Shaka Cuts was a barber booking platform that allowed individuals to book haircuts. Over the course of the app we facilitated over 10,000 haircuts, targeting Greater London and Oxford. I was a member of the founding team and worked as Growth Lead within the development and marketing teams.</p>

      <p>10 years ago, I entered a national hackathon for technically gifted young developers and digital marketers aged 18 and under across the UK. My team and I was tasked with building an application using open government data. In turn, we created a website to help young people understand politics in order for them to make an informed decision when voting in the general elections. </p>
